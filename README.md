## Please Note

Requires a PostgreSQL server. Download the server application here:
[https://github.com/stuart-gill/postgresql-comments-api.git](https://github.com/stuart-gill/postgresql-comments-api.git)
And set up a PostgreSQL database on your local machine per the provided README

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

And then

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Basic Funcitonality:

When the React application loads, it calls a fetch api to get all the comments (author/comment/id/timestamp objects) from the database and displays them in the very basic UI. If the user adds a new comment and their name, their new comment will appear at the bottom of the list. It appears there not because the Get API was called again, but because the comment's data was used to update the local state. This data was also sent to update the database.

For uniformity's sake, the timestamp is generated by the database. Currently, new comments are displayed with a default timestamp (epoch), but once the page is reloaded, the official timestamp from the server is shown. I consider this a bug that needs some work.
